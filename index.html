				<p>The main reason I decided to develop this app was to make it easier for my friends and I to plan out our road trips. We would often mix up who was responsible for bringing what, or we would simply forget to bring what we were responsible for bringing. Likewise, I felt that a synchronized checklist app such as this would make it easier for smaller day trips, such as preparing for a simple party or getting supplies ready for a day of fishing. While it <em>is</em> a relatively simple application, I also felt that this app would help me get some more practice with using Firebase.
